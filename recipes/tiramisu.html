    <p>
      This delicious and unbelievably easy Tiramisu recipe is made with coffee
      soaked lady fingers, sweet and creamy mascarpone (no raw eggs!), and cocoa
      powder dusted on top. It requires no baking and can be made in advance!

      Who doesn’t love an easy no-bake dessert? That’s one of the best things
      about this tiramisu recipe. If you are looking quick no-bake dessert I
      also love No Bake Peanut Butter Pretzel Bars and Butterscotch Cereal Bars.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ladyfingers: I buy them, but you could make them from scratch.</li>
      <li>
        Mascarpone: it wouldn't be true tiramisu without mascarpone, but if you
        absolutely must, you could substitute cream cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Coffee: I use espresso</li>
      <li>Heavy Whipped cream</li>
      <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
      <li>Vanilla extract: or substitute imitation vanilla</li>
      <li>Cocoa powder: for dusting on top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix creamy filling. Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla
        together until stiff peaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip lady fingers. Add the espresso and liqueur (if using) to a shallow
        bowl and dip the lady fingers on both sides (don't let them soak–just a
        quick dip!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer mascarpone. Smooth a layer of the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture
        on top of the lady fingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat. Add another layer of lady fingers (dipped in coffee and liqueur)
        and another layer of cheese mixture. Dust with cocoa powder.
      </li>
    </ol>
