    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In this classic lasagna recipe, sheets of pasta are layered with a cheesy
      filling, a rich meaty tomato sauce, and more cheese and then baked until
      bubbly and browned.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
        <p>
          For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and
          parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or
          replace it with cottage cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Meat</h3>
        <p>
          I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using
          all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to
          the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <p>
          To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s
          easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if
          you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Spinach (variation)</h3>
        <p>
          Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna,
          thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it
          along with the cheese layer.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      While homemade lasagna may have a few steps, each step is easy – and I
      assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the
        recipe below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain
        well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few
        minutes to thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna
        noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
